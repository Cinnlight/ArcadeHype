# Game Release Countdown

## Overview
This project displays a countdown timer for the release dates of various games. Users can view the current release date of a game they are interested in, search for different games by category, and read a blurb about each game underneath the countdown. Additionally, users can make comments and notes on games that save locally for later reference.
